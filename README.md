MA615 Kritik assignment: Is there evidence of global warming in the data collected by a single weather buoy in the NOAA National Data Buoy Center?  The Boston Buoy Data Analysis project requires you to complete a project in its entirety from acquiring data to presenting results.  As you work, keep the goals and vision for the completed work in perspective.  This is only class session 6 in the semester.  You will encounter lots of practical problems as you complete the analysis and prepare the assignment for submission.  That's the point.  Keep it simple.  Finish on time.  A process of ongoing learning by doing and learning from others is one of the hallmarks of practice-oriented disciplines.
