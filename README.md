# Summary

In this report, we found evidence showing global warming in the Boston buoy data set from 1987 to 2016, with total 246,245 observations. The whole analysis process is consisted by four parts:

* Read data from URLs of NOAA and combine into a single data.frame.

* Transform separated time variables into one and prepare for analysis.

* Perform data analysis with WTMP *(Water Temperature)* 

* Perform data analysis with ATMP *(Air Temperature)*

As a result, from annual perspective, the analysis revealed that both the annual mean water temperature and air temperature shows slightly upward trends (0.005413℃/year, 0.003434℃/year respectively) as indications of global warming. Then, from monthly perspective, 8 out of 12 months shows annually increasing trends on average water (Jan, Feb, Jul, Nov.) and air temperature (Jan, Feb, Mar, Nov). Besides, the upward trends of temperature in summer and downward trends of temperature in winter indicate an increase in extreme weather which is also a indicator of global warming.
